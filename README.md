# CS50-PSet-3-Runoff

This is my code of the program that runs a runoff election, for Harvard's CS50 problems set 1.

## Specifications:

Complete the implementation of runoff.c in such a way that it simulates a runoff election. You should complete the implementations of the vote, tabulate, print_winner, find_min, is_tie, and eliminate functions.

For more detailed specifications, see:
